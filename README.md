# zlist ⚡️

> A simple, colorful alternative to `ls` built with **Zig**.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/here-Leslie-Lau/zlist)
[![Zig Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/zig-0.16.0_dev-orange?style=flat-square)](https://ziglang.org/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

**Note**: This is my **first CLI tool in Zig**! 🚀

I built this project to learn Zig, get comfortable with manual memory management, and explore the standard library. It might not be the fastest or smallest `ls` clone (yet), but it's usable today and still getting better.

## ✨ Features

Already pretty capable for a learning project:

*   **Compact grid layout** that stays easy to scan.
*   **Color and Nerd Font icons** for common file types and languages.
*   **Readable long view** with permissions, owner, size, and timestamps.
*   **Optional recursive directory size** in long view and size sorting.
*   **Multiple sort modes** including name, length, directories first, mtime, and size.
*   **Recursive listing** with optional depth limits.
*   **Useful filters** for files, directories, extensions, names, size, and modified time.
*   **Quick summary report** for file and folder counts.
*   **Git status indicators** in long view.

*(Make sure you have a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed in your terminal to see the icons!)*

<a id="installation"></a>
## 🚀 Installation

### Precompiled Binaries

Download the latest binary for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/here-Leslie-Lau/zlist/releases) page.

> **Note**: Windows is currently **not supported** due to differences in file system APIs. Support may be added in future versions.

### From Source

Requirements: `zig` (master/0.16.0-dev recommended).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:here-Leslie-Lau/zlist.git
cd zlist

# 2. Build in release mode [ReleaseFast, ReleaseSafe, ReleaseSmall]
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# 3. Run it. (Optional: add to PATH, it's up to you.)
./zig-out/bin/zl
```

<a id="usage"></a>
## 🛠 Usage

Just run:

```bash
zl [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-l`, `--long` | Show detailed view (permissions, size, date, user). |
| `-a`, `--a` | Show hidden files (starting with `.`). |
| `--du` | Show recursive directory size in long view and size sorting. This is the sum of file sizes, so it may differ from `du` disk usage. |
| `-s`, `--sort <mode>` | `name` (A-Z) [Default]<br>`length` (Shortest first)<br>`dir_first` (Dirs first)<br>`mtime` (Newest first)<br>`size` (Largest first) |
| `-r`, `--recursive` | Recurse into subdirectories. |
| `-L`, `--level <INT>` | Limit the depth of recursion (use `0` for infinite depth). |
| `-p`, `--pure` | Clean output without colors or icons (useful for pipes). |
| `-d`, `--dir` | Only show directories. |
| `-D`, `--no_dir` | Only show files (hide directories). |
| `-e`, `--ext <str>...` | Hide files by extension, e.g. `--ext zig,go,ts`. |
| `-m`, `--match <str>...` | Only show names that contain the given text, e.g. `--match test`. |
| `--size <str>...` | Only show files in a size range, e.g. `--size gt:10K --size lte:2M`. Supports `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `eq` and units `B`, `K`, `M`, `G`, `T`. |
| `--changed-within <str>` | Only show entries changed within a time range, e.g. `--changed-within 7d`. Supports `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`. |
| `-R`, `--report` | Show a brief summary of file and folder counts. |
| `-g`, `--git` | Show Git status indicators (requires `-l` to work). |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print help message. |

### Examples

**Standard list:**
```bash
zl
```

**Show all files with details (sorted by filename length):**
```bash
zl -la -s length
```

**Show recursive directory sizes in long view:**
```bash
zl -l --du
```

**Sort by recursive directory size:**
```bash
zl --du -s size -l
```

**Dig deep (recursive listing):**
```bash
# Basic recursive (infinite)
zl -r

# Limit recursion to 2 levels deep
zl -L 2
```

**Clean output (no colors/icons):**
```bash
zl -p
```

**Filter by file type (directories only / files only):**
```bash
zl -d
zl -D
```

**Exclude some extensions:**
```bash
zl --ext zig,go,ts
```

**Match by name:**
```bash
zl --match test
```

**Filter files by size:**
```bash
zl --size lt:10K
zl --size gt:10K --size lte:2M
```

**Show files changed recently:**
```bash
zl --changed-within 7d
```

**Show summary report:**
```bash
zl -R
```

**Show Git status (must be used with `-l`):**
```bash
zl -lg
```

## Benchmark

Quick check on a directory with 50K files, using plain output only: no icons, no colors, output redirected to `/dev/null`. (I used `hyperfine` for benchmarking)

| Tool | Command | Mean time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `zl` | `zl -p /path > /dev/null` | `41.8 ms ± 0.6 ms` |
| `eza` | `eza /path > /dev/null` | `180.3 ms ± 2.0 ms` |
| macOS `/bin/ls` | `/bin/ls /path > /dev/null` | `169.3 ms ± 6.0 ms` |

In this run, `zl` came out about 4x faster than both `eza` and the system `ls`.

*Benchmark results may vary depending on filesystem and hardware.*
